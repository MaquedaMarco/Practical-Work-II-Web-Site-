        <div id="Content_Topic_box1">
            <p>When I was finishing my baccalaureate degree, on my mathematics class I had to send a "Mathematical Exploration Essay" which is in essence an essay about a mathematical topic of my choosing. This was worth 25% of the final grade<br><br>I decided to make mine about calculating the long term probability of the boardg game Monopoly.<br><br>I did this beacuse of two reasons:<br><br>1.- It allowed me to study Markov Chains, a process that uses Matrcies to calculate the long term probabilities of events. As I didn't have matrices on my syllabus, I thought it made a good match.<br><br>2.- I would put my coding test skills to the test as I hadn't made any programming since 4 years prior, and what I knew was from a summer when I watched around 5 youtube videos on how to programm on C#.<br><br>Coming up next are part of the process and the conclusion of the essay, plus some further reading for those interested.</p>

            <p>This is the graph that represetnts the Long-Term Probability of ending up on a given square of the board against the assaigned number for that square.<br><br>This probabilties where obtained using Markov chains, which by the way created a 40x40 matrix, that had to me evaluated to the limit when n tends to infinity when that matrix is to the power of n, which was something that went way beyond my mathematical understanding at the time.<br><br>If you are curious, the most landed square was jail, and the least the chance squres.<br>Allthouigh is important to note that the probabilities are of <b>ENDING</b> on a given square, not first landing there, then you move if you have to.</p>

        <div id="Content_Topic_box5">
            <p>This is the same graph from earlier, plus the long-term probability calculated using the code I created.<br><br>At the time I didn't know about Arrays, or how While loops really worked, so this translated on apart from a very inefficient code, that instead of giving me the probabilities of the simulation it gave me the raw numbers, and I had to copy 10 000 of them to later using another program count how many times a square appeared on the code. This made my programm crash more times that I would like to admit.<br><br>And as you can rpobablly imagine, it made the whole process of data collecting quite cumbersome.</p>
