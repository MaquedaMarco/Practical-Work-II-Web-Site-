The website contains differetnt webpages about the wepsite, about me, how to contact me, my university degree, about the topic of calculating the Long Term probability of Monopoly, and the links to other colleagues websites.

Some of the chalenges I've faced during this assigment were first the difficulty of creating what I had in mind, to actually coding it. At first I strated using a template, but i could't make things work as I wanted them to do, so I decided to create my own webpage from scrath. At first every thing was going quite smooth, but then a lot of problems started to arose with made it impsible to continue. In those cases I ended up going into google to reserach more about HTML and CSS in order to get through said problems and hvae a more faithfull website to the one I had in mind. Nevertheless, the website ended up looking way different of what I was hoping for, and allthough I belive I did a good effort on sorting certain probelms, some became imposible fro me to solve, which was very frustrating.
Another problem I had during this assimnet was time management. At firt when I looked at the project and the vision I had in mind, I didn't think it would take me a fraction of the time it ended up taking. This in turn made me rush ceratin parts of the website in order to dont go over due the deadline of the assigment, making ceratin sections of the website functional, but less the optimal. This also made an impact on the code of the website, making it much worese that other wise oculd have been if I had given it more time to go through it and improve it.

In conclusion, I'm learned quite a lot of html and css that I thought I would, it helped me at discovering how project at this scale have solved and how to train my mind at problem solving when I dound a barrier that stopped me from continuing further. This in turn has help me develop my mind closer to what a programmer would think like, helping me in other subjects such as PRograming I.
